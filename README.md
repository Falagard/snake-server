# Snake Server For Haxe 

This is a fork of https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/snake-server with some improvements, including a thread pool, and changes to make it non-blocking on the main thread. 

Most of the changes revolve around using socket.setBlocking(false) and then reading from the input in a loop in handleOneRequest, and this version of snake-server is specifically built to be the basis for [SideWinder](https://github.com/Falagard/SideWinder/)


Create TCP and HTTP servers with the [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language, or run `haxelib run snake-server` to start a local HTTP server that serves static files in a specific directory.

> **Warning!** snake-server is not recommended for production. It only implements basic security checks.

Available on [Haxe sys targets](https://haxe.org/manual/std-sys.html) only.

## Installation

Use the [**haxelib install**](https://lib.haxe.org/documentation/using-haxelib/#install) command to download Snake Server.

```sh
haxelib install snake-server
```

Requires Haxe 4.1 or newer.

## Command Line

Use the [**haxelib run**](https://lib.haxe.org/documentation/using-haxelib/#run) command to launch Snake Server in the current directory on port 8000.

```sh
haxelib run snake-server
```

## Why did you choose "snake" for the name? üêç

The Snake Server project's Haxe code is actually ported from the [Python](https://python.org/) language's [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html) and [socketserver](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html) modules. [Pythons](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(genus)>) are also a [type of snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake). The name is simply meant to pay tribute to the code's origins.
